= Shipping a Web App into a Kubernetes Cluster

This tutorial aims to be a didactic kickstart material for onboarding a web app into a Kubernetes cluster from scratch.
First, we will create a Kubernetes cluster on a local machine using link:https://devops-stack.io[the Devops Stack].
Then, we will deploy a `hello-world` app. 
Finally, we will deploy an app into the cluster and show how to manage it like a pro, with some of the best Open Source monitoring and deployment DevOps tools available.

== Objectives

- Creating your Local Kubernetes Cluster on your local docker system using link:https://devops-stack.io[the Devops Stack]
- Onboarding a `hello-world` app into the k8s cluster
- Onboarding a `web app` into the k8s cluster

== Context: the Web App

Let's imagine for a second you are software developer helping a friend set up an e-commerce site to sell some products online.
You already have written parts of your app, a sort of a proof-of-concept.

Your app consists of:

* a basic REST API __backend__ which can be used for:
   - Retrieving products info
   - Buying products
   - Retrieving quantity of products views
   - Retrieving quantity of products bought
* a basic __frontend__ to interact with your REST API.

link:https://github.com/camptocamp/containers-course-app/[Here is a git repository] with the app we are going to use for this tutorial.
The app consists of a __backend__ written in 3 different languages (Go, Python and Java) and a __frontend__ (written in PHP).

[WARNING]
The tutorial will use an example web app written by Camptocamp for trainings.
This is simply a dummy client/server web app meant to be used for demo purposes only.

Now, to set up some context, imagine the code still needs some enhancements but your friend insists that the sites needs to go live given that his warehouse is already full and new arrivals are coming in the upcoming weeks!
So like a fluttering bird pushed from the nest your app needs to fly now.

== Requirements

A few important requirements to take into account before going to production are:

* The app implements a minimal set of features, new ones will come in the near future, hence **several iterations of the site may have to be rolled-out**
* These iterations may contain bugs as new features are introduced, hence **the deployment may have to be rolled-back to a previous working state**
* The e-commerce site may grow in popularity so the engine that serves all the REST API calls can cope with the requests, hence **the deployment may have to be scaled-up**


[TIP]
.Start day 1 on the right foot!
====
This tutorial will demonstrate how onboarding the web app into a Kubernetes cluster provides you with an environment where these requirements are met off the shelf.
You will be able to test k8s features from the comfort of your localhost.
Redeploying into other k8s clusters will be straightforward.
